# Springboard

This repository consists of all of my coursework from Springboard's Data Science Bootcamp. 

Here, I have compiled mini-projects along with a capstone project to illustrate my proficiency with such important skills as data wrangling, data visualization, statistical analysis, clustering as well as machine learning algorithms such as linear and logisitc regression and random forests.
